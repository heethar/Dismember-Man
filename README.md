# Dismember-Man
Is it like hangman, but instead of hanging a man, you are dismembering each limb if you cannot correct each word.

If you would like to entertain someone (or yourself) with this rudimentary game of hangman, you can customize the difficulty of words by editing the associated .txt file.

Currently, it works best with 8-letter words, but you can change the amount of letters the program expects, as well.
